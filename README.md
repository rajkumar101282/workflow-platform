# workflow-platform
AI-augmented internal workflow platform for managing role-based processes and state-driven operations. Designed with API-first architecture, clear data models, and maintainability in mind. Focused on reducing operational ambiguity through system design.
## Problem

Operational workflows in many organizations depend on manual coordination, implicit rules, and unclear ownership, leading to errors, delays, and scalability issues.

## Approach

This system converts real-world operational processes into explicit, state-driven workflows using API-first design, role-based access control, and clear data models.

## Design Principles

- Explicit workflow states and transitions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable API contracts
- Data consistency over convenience
- Maintainability over premature optimization

## AI Usage

AI tools are used to accelerate iteration, reduce boilerplate, and assist debugging. All system design, architectural decisions, and trade-offs are human-led.

## Status

Initial system structure and core workflow definitions are under active development.
